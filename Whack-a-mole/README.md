Whack-a-mole
========

This is my first ever android app. The basic ideea was to create a simple game of whack-a-mole but this is not the final build and it doesnt work.

##Installation
In order to get the app on your phone you have 2 option:
* Download the project and search in its folder a "WhackAMole.apk" file. Transfer in onto your device and install it. Make sure to [enable loading apps from unknown sources](http://developer.android.com/distribute/open.html#unknown-sources) first.

##Additional info
This app was made in a very old version of Eclipe, the odds of importing it in Android Strudio are pretty slim...
